## Overview

This page describes how to identify motor parameters by means of PMC. The
knowledge of parameters is necessary to control. Any new motor connected to the
PMC should be identified before run in closed control loop.

## Preparation

You may need to adjust some parameters in accordance with the capabilities of
the motor to not burn it. Default is acceptable for most RC motors but be
aware. These parameters are used to probe the motor.

	# reg pm.probe

There are a lot of parameters that can affect the motor identification. But we
believe that they will need a change only in a very complicated case.

## Sensors adjustment

To achieve a good result adjust the voltage and current sensors. If you have a
accurate voltmeter do an adjustment with standard. To do this measure the
supply voltage and call the command.

	# pm_STD_voltage <U>

Note that our PCB has 1% divider tolerance and 0.2% reference voltage. So you
need more accurate measurement.

To adjust the current sensors you will need a standard resistor. Choose a
resistance value based on supply voltage to get large enough current. Values
from 1 to 5 Ohm are fit. It would be nice to have at least 1% resistor
tolerance.  Connect the resistor to the terminal A and B then call the
command.

	# pm_STD_current <R>

If you do not have a voltage or resistance standard skip the above steps.

Next is automatic self-adjustment that is necessary for matching the voltage
measurement channels. Also current sensors will be self-adjusted if motor is
connected.

	# pm_self_adjust

This is enough to do it once and save the values in the flash. But we recommend
to do it again when you change supply voltage.

## Number of the rotor pole pairs

This number connects the electrical speed with the mechanical. We believe you
are able to identify Zp simply by counting the number of magnets on the rotor
then divide it by 2. This is the most famous method.

	# reg pm.const_Zp <N>

If access to the motor is restricted and to count the magnets is impossible
then just leave a value 1. Instead of mechanical speed you will see electrical
speed. By measuring the mechanical speed directly you can estimate Zp and set
it later.

## Impedance of stator windings

Resistance is measured by holding a constant current vector for some time.
Assuming that the rotor was fixed we can determine R as U/I. For greater
accuracy you need to increase the probe current and reduce the supply voltage.

We use a high frequency sinusoidal signal to measure the full impedance then we
calculate DQ inductance and rotation angle.

	# pm_probe_base

Normally it will print the values of the identified parameters. In case of
failure the error will be printed out. We recommend to do this procedure twice
to get accurate estimates.

## Rotor flux linkage

This parameter also known as Kv rating. Internal representation is E that
linked with Kv by following equation.

	                 60
	E = ----------------------------
	     2 * PI * sqrt(3) * Kv * Zp

To identify E you have to run in closed loop. Also the rotor should rotate at
significant speed. We do a forced spinup to reach this condition.

	# pm_probe_spinup

To get more accurate estimate run the motor at high speed (~10v of BEMF is
enough) and request E probe manually. Do not load the motor.

	# reg pm.s_setpoint_rpm <rpm>
	# reg pm.fsm_state 12
