# Phobia Motor Controller

PMC is an open project that aims to build the quality permanent magnet
synchronous motor (PMSM) controller for use in a variety of scopes like RC or
electrotransport.

	* Two analog input channels (from 0 to 6v).
* Auxiliary interfaces:
	* Two combined ports with: SPI, I2C, USART, ADC, DAC, GPIO (3.3v).
	* BOOT and RESET pins to use embedded bootloader.
	* SWD to hardware debug.

## Software features

* Sensorless vector control of PMSM based on two inline current measurements.
* Advanced PWM scheme to reduce switching losses and fully utilise DC link voltage.
* Fast and robust multi-hypothesis flux observer (MHFO) with gain scheduling.
* Terminal voltage sensing to reduce the effect of Dead-Time.
* Automated motor parameters identification with no additional tools.
* Self test of hardware integrity to diagnose troubles.
* Flux weakening control (**EXPERIMENTAL**).
* Terminal voltage tracking to get smooth start when motor is already running (**EXPERIMENTAL**).
* Two phase machine support (e.g. bipolar stepper) (**EXPERIMENTAL**).
* Advanced command line interface (CLI) with autocompletion and history.
* Non critical tasks are managed by [FreeRTOS](http://www.freertos.org/).
* Flash storage for all of configurable parameters.

* Operation at low or zero speed:
	* Forced control that applies a current vector without feedback to force rotor turn.
	* High frequency injection (HFI) based on magnetic saliency (**EXPERIMENTAL**).
	* Hall Sensors or Quadrature Encoder (**TODO**).
* Control loops:
	* Current control is always enabled.
	* Brake function when current control is in use.
	* Speed control loop.
	* Servo operation (**EXPERIMENTAL**).
	* Battery charger (**TODO**).
	* Voltage rectifier (**TODO**).
* Adjustable limits:
	* Phase current (with adjustable derate from overheat).
	* Source current (or power) consumption and regeneration.
	* DC link overvoltage and undervoltage.
	* Maximal speed and acceleration (as part of speed control loop).
* Control inputs:
	* CAN bus (**TODO**).
	* RC servo pulse width.
	* STEP/DIR (**TODO**).
	* Analog input with brake signal.
	* Manual control through CLI.
	* Custom embedded application can implement any control strategy.
* Available information:
	* Total distance traveled.
	* Source energy (Wh) and charge (Ah) consumed (or reverted).
	* Fuel gauge percentage.
	* Peak values.

## TODO

* Analyse HFI operation on large current values.
* Make a detailed documentation.

## Current Status

Now we can declare that PMC is ready to use in most applications. But there is
still a lot of unresolved issues. It may be difficult to configure the PMC for
a specific motor.

There are a few videos that show the operation of the prototypes (may be outdated).
